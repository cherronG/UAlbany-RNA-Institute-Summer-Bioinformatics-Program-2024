# UAlbany-RNA-Institute-Summer-Bioinformatics-Program-2024
This repository documents my experience at the 2024 RNA Institute Summer Bioinformatics Program at the University at Albany, showcasing project presentations and some selected R programming completed during the program. 

## Program Description
The RNA Institute Summer Bioinformatics Program is a comprehensive 7-week fully virtual training program designed to equip students with fundamental skills in RNA-sequencing data analysis through interactive lectures and independent computational research. Weekly research and professional development seminars are held to provide networking opportunities with faculty and peers. The program concludes with student presentations at the 2024 Summer Bioinformatics Virtual Symposium, where participants showcase their research findings and analytical work.

## Program Structure
### Part 1: Foundational Training and Project 1
- one-hour lectures covering core bioinformatics concepts
- small group sessions with student mentors
- development of basic programming skills
- application of skills to an RNA-sequencing training dataset for Project 1

### Part 2: Independent Research and Project 2
- independent Project 2 under faculty mentor supervision
- hands-on experience with real-world bioinformatics challenges
- continued small group sessions for additional guidance

## Tools and Skills
- **HPCC:** Unix, STAR alignment of FASTQ files, rMATS for AS analysis 
- **RStudio:** R, DESeq for DGE analysis, data visualization (PCA, MA, Volcano, Heatmap, Normalize Counts, Sashimi, Violin)
- **Metascape:** GO enrichment analysis 

## Repository Contents 
This repository includes:
- final project presentations
- selected R programming scripts and analyses for each project
- presentation scripts for each project containing added detail of my research process and analytical findings
